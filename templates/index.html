				<h2>The Smarter State: Systematically Matching Expertise to Problems</h2>
				<p>There is possibly no more important public issue today than how to evolve our governing organizations to make them better able to recognize and implement innovative and effective ways of solving 21st Century problems. Governments need to learn to make use of the full gamut of expertise — formal scientific knowledge and credentials, but also skills, experiences and craft know-how — to tackle the challenges society will face in the coming years.</p>

  				<h3>The Technologies of Smarter Governance</h3>
          <p>Over the last decade software makes it possible to identify with precision who knows what and match them to opportunities to serve. These tools -- expert networking platforms, people search, expert discovery, expertise retrieval, expert finding, expert profiling, and e-expertise tools -- help to answer the question: who knows what. We are researching existing and designing new tools to make expertise searchable.</p>

  				<h3>The Law of Smarter Governance</h3>
          <p>It is not an exaggeration to say that today’s information laws at the federal level in the United States, especially the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act, impede robust citizen engagement. We are working to craft law and policy to support smarter governance (in collaboration with Yale Law School).</p>

        	<h3>The Smarter Governance Research Agenda</h3>
  				<p>When does targeting expertise enhance participation and problem solving? The research agenda on smarter governance requires answering, such questions as what kinds of expertise are most helpful to identify and the resulting real-world impact. The goal is to develop an understanding of whether and how targeting participation based on expertise (crowdsourcing wisely) might lead to more effective and more legitimate outcomes than broad citizen engagement (crowdsourcing widely).</p>
