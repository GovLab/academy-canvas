# GovLab Canvas

## Basic Usage (CORE)

- User registers (oAuth - google>twitter>facebook>github) - https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/github.html
- Renders a blank canvas with a unique URL ( suggestion: canvas.govlab.org/username )
- User fills in his info in the boxes (content editable)
- the URL shows the canvas information. If logged in, contenteditable is enable

## Nice to have

- print CSS for Letter-sized paper (multipage)
- after register, system fires an email with the canvas URL
- markdown support
- autosave, instead of save button (status message to inform the user that it is saved)
- UNDO button (inbox style)
